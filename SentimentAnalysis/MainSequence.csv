"Unknown","00:00:00:00","00:00:28:12","We'll just copy over that. Okay. All right. Okay. Hi. My name is Morgan Santa. I am the director for the Center for Cybersecurity Innovation at City University of Seattle. We are. And the National Center of Academic Excellence recognized by the NSA. I'm also the program manager for the Bachelor's and master's degree in cybersecurity."
"Unknown","00:00:28:12","00:01:01:21","Penny. Okay. This is the second year of our NASA funded cybersecurity high school innovation grant. The purpose of this grant is to create more teachers trained to instruct cybersecurity at the high school level. So in year two, we've made some very interesting changes from lessons learned through our teachers, who are in seven different states teaching across the spectrum from high school."
"Unknown","00:01:01:21","00:01:32:09","We actually have a couple of teachers that were teaching high school last year and are now teaching middle school and high school will include some of these lessons learned through interviews that you hear from them. And we hope to be producing some additional videos, PowerPoints and publishing some papers to help you wherever you are in the country to develop more cybersecurity, high school and middle school teachers."
"Unknown","00:01:32:09","00:02:08:18","Right. Oh, really? Can you briefly tell me about yourself? Certainly. I've been a teacher for a long time. I'm retired college instructor from Mount Hood Community College and taught there for 19 years full time and part time. 13 years. Started this cybersecurity program good 15 years ago at Mount Hood. And it's been built up and running quite successfully."
"Unknown","00:02:08:18","00:02:41:11","And even though I'm retired, I still am teaching classes for the cybersecurity degree. And what made you get involved in this grant? Oh, basically, I was kind of tagged by a colleague who couldn't fulfill the obligation when he was asked to do it, and after a couple of weeks realize he's overloaded. And the answer to all your retired, why don't you take on this grant?"
"Unknown","00:02:41:11","00:03:17:07","So I became part of the grant and part of the teaching support in it. Okay. So you motivate your students to learn about cybersecurity. For for my area being in the college community, college, it's not too tough. They they want and the nice thing about our our school is that we have kind of a go with the veterans."
"Unknown","00:03:17:11","00:03:41:21","So we have a lot of vets, both men and women in our program at the College as far as the high school and getting down into the high school, the students are recognizing and it's becoming more and more obvious that there is a great need in in the market for people with some kind of cybersecurity background and training."
"Unknown","00:03:41:23","00:03:59:23","So we have good training program. You know, I'm pushing my school, obviously, but they they do a really good job in the different degrees that we have."
"Unknown","00:04:00:01","00:04:41:07","What impact have you made for this child? Grant I don't know that, you know, I become an ambassador for the National Cyber League, which is a competition group, and really trying to push that and showing the high school instructors that this is really a positive way to go and the excitement they can generate after school and with the students in being a part of this competition, the games that cyber and it's twice a year so it works out quite nicely and even at the lowest level."
"Unknown","00:04:41:07","00:05:11:00","Student As far as cyber not knowing too much they they come out excited and saying, I want to do this again. I have students at the college level that after they graduate, are still participating in the national security. And so that's one of the areas that I, I really feel like I'm I'm in here for supporting that and the different competitions that go around."
"Unknown","00:05:11:00","00:05:57:01","I don't have a lot of the programing and expertise and things like that. I made mainly a networking guy, so networking and and cyber competitions are what what I'm about. Yeah, and one less thing. What are your three takeaways for the year from this year? Well, it's it's nice to have one the second year group that we can take to a different level and get them excited about becoming more of an expert in teaching by giving them more resources in in teaching and being able to once again in the second year work with my colleagues."
"Unknown","00:05:57:03","00:06:21:06","That's that's been a delight, you know, just expanding my network of people across the country that I can reach out to and ask advice and get information as well as sitting in on those who have the expertise that I don't have and learning myself. I'm still learning. Even though I'm retired and I'm an old guy, I'm still learning and never stop learning."
"Unknown","00:06:21:10","00:06:32:17","Yeah. All right. Thank you so much, Paul. Christa, you're most welcome. Thank you. I try not to look at the camera and look at you, but it's fine."
"Unknown","00:06:32:17","00:07:04:15","All right. Can you briefly tell me about yourself? Yeah, I'm Terri Bright, and I taught for 39 years, the last ten years at a charter school that public school owned by three different school districts. And I taught five year security and coding for the last ten years. What made you get involved in this grant? Get involved? For two reasons."
"Unknown","00:07:04:15","00:07:37:00","One, I was asked to help write the curriculum for the first year students participants who wanted to teach cybersecurity. And the second is I have a passion for cybersecurity in getting students aware of the job opportunities that are there. So to prepare them to continue with their furthering education and also emotional compassion about personal cybersecurity. So I wanted to teach them how they could secure themselves."
"Unknown","00:07:37:02","00:08:21:00","How do you motivate your students to learn about security? I think just to get them motivated for through a couple of things. One of them is, like I said, personal security, showing how much data is being exposed about themselves, about their parents, and then showing on all the job possibilities that are in cybersecurity, if they like health, but they don't want to become a witness or a doctor or nurse, they still can be part of the health professional, or probably one of the other most motivating factors was competitions in cybersecurity contests."
"Unknown","00:08:21:01","00:08:50:07","And there they started to learn more on their own than they were from myself. And just to see the excitement when they solved it. A problem. I found that to be the biggest motivator right? What impact have you made for the Troy Grant? This is the second year that I helped write the curriculum and we revised it this year with the first year participants."
"Unknown","00:08:50:07","00:09:22:11","It's going to be teach us cybersecurity for the first time. Last year we heard a lot that, hey, we would like to have a curriculum that's already produced ready to go. So this year we're showing the teachers how to use the teach cyber curriculum, which is a good introductory course for a lot of colleges. And so they could also articulate, hopefully that's been contributing that a major impact this year compared to last year."
"Unknown","00:09:22:13","00:09:52:06","And lastly, what are you three takeaways from this year? Three takeaways. One of them is just mentioning in our class this morning is that the participants we have in this first year are engaging that I hadn't seen last year, and I think it's because now we're moving beyond the pandemic and people are starting to interact more often. So that's been encouraging."
"Unknown","00:09:52:08","00:10:18:04","And just to watch the excitement that I started my own students as they are trying to solve their own competition problems and issues. And probably the most satisfying thing is to listen to one of the teachers, as I heard, and my oldest is I got it. And so that just becomes exciting. And that what that's the main thing that I've taken away this year."
"Unknown","00:10:18:06","00:10:35:04","The other one is just listening to the other faculty members at the universities and hearing what they're doing, which to me is motivating them as to what's going on. All right. Thank you so much. Okay. Attica. Yeah."
"Unknown","00:10:35:06","00:10:36:16","Thank you."
"Unknown","00:10:36:16","00:11:04:16","Okay. All right. So can you tell me briefly about yourself? Yeah. My name's Rob Hanna Michael, and I'm a assistant professor of cyber operations at the University of Arizona. Prior to that, I taught at another university in South Dakota, and I was also a high school computer teacher for before that. Okay. What made you get involved in this grant?"
"Unknown","00:11:04:17","00:11:29:10","So I've done a lot of teacher professional development. And so when I was asked if I would be a part of it, it follows really close in line with with other things that I'm working on, things that I'm doing, working with teachers. And then also just kind of pushing the cybersecurity into the high schools. Right. How do you motivate your students to learn about security?"
"Unknown","00:11:29:12","00:11:49:23","I think motivating students, a lot of it comes from helping them understand how it works in their personal and their professional lives, just how they can better protect themselves or people that they care about. I think those are some of the things that as you talk about different topics and they we can relate to them in different ways, that really helps with the motivation."
"Unknown","00:11:50:01","00:12:17:04","All right. What impact have you made for China? I think the impact really comes from just having good discussions about how to teach different things or how to look at it differently than maybe they've thought about if they have done it before. But then I think just finding those resources and helping them with the curriculum of how they're going to integrate it into their classroom."
"Unknown","00:12:17:06","00:12:41:17","Okay. Well, I think one of your three takeaways for this year. Three takeaways from this year. I think one of them is really the collaboration amongst the faculty being able to work with people from different states and see how they teach a topic or how they explain something has been really beneficial for me and how I'm going to integrate it into my own classes."
"Unknown","00:12:41:18","00:13:03:22","I think the other takeaway is really the relationships with the participants. I think, and that ongoing relationship, you know, the time that we we got to know each other through the online part of them this week while we're out here. And then I think going forward, being able to continue helping them, mentor them and those type of things and help them grow inside their own classes will be a big one."
"Unknown","00:13:04:00","00:13:30:14","And then the third takeaway, I think just, you know, finding new ideas. I think I think everybody is benefiting from everybody, right? I think faculty benefit from the participants. I think the participants, you know, benefit from each other. And so I think that professional learning community that's developed through that time is really important because I think now we're going to have our own little network of people that we can keep sharing ideas with."
"Unknown","00:13:30:14","00:13:38:11","So. Okay. All right. That's it. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I."
"Speake1","00:13:38:11","00:13:45:10","Okay. All right. Ready?"
"Speake2","00:13:45:12","00:13:46:21","Emily."
"Speake1","00:13:46:23","00:13:50:12","Can you briefly tell me about yourself?"
"Speake2","00:13:50:14","00:14:44:19","You want me to tell you a tell you about myself? So I am Pick Virginie. I am the program director for the Information Technology Program at Missoula College. I earned my Ph.D. at Washington State University in networking computer networks. I should say the emphasis in security and I've been working in this field for about 22 years. I started as an information systems auditor for the state of Montana, and I worked in software development and quality assurance and research and what I did before coming to Missoula colleges, we did research and creating sort of holistic security devices for companies where we would, you know, all of the security in a single box for pattern matching, high"
"Speake2","00:14:44:19","00:14:54:05","speed pattern matching, then processing and other other types of things like that. Mm hmm."
"Speake1","00:14:54:07","00:14:57:19","What made you get involved in this grant?"
"Speake2","00:14:57:21","00:15:21:03","Well, it fits with a lot of what we're trying to do at Missoula College. And it also is just something that the country needs as we need more people that are aware of cybersecurity because it's cyber security is not like computer science or programing, because computer science in programing, you can say, oh, well, the programmers and the computer scientists will do that."
"Speake2","00:15:21:05","00:15:41:14","And yeah, okay, great, that's fine, that works. But cyber security is something that everybody has to do at some level. I mean, you can't get away from it in the people that try to get away from it are the ones that put everyone else at risk. And so part of it is we need we need to build more cybersecurity into our society as a as a whole."
"Speake2","00:15:41:14","00:16:05:03","Like we learn how to be. You learn stranger danger. You learn, you know, the other things to try to keep us safe. Well, you know, cybersecurity is, you know, your password should not be three characters long. You know, you know, some of this basic stuff because when you do that, it isn't just you that you're affecting in society as a whole."
"Speake1","00:16:05:05","00:16:12:15","Yeah. How do you motivate your students to learn about their security motivation?"
"Speake2","00:16:12:17","00:16:41:00","Um, I, you know, there's a lot of there's a lot of talk about how do you how do you motivate someone to do this and how do you motivate someone to do that? I actually don't believe you can really motivate anyone to do anything. I, I think the best that you can do is show people what's out there and spark their own motivation, you know, and spark their interest, I guess."
"Speake2","00:16:41:02","00:17:13:08","And in so doing, then they become self-motivated. And so how do I do that? Well, my goal really is, is I you know, I try to be patient. I certainly, you know, patience is the number one quality that you need to really teach more than anything, I believe, and then always are good at it. But then the next part is you just have to expose people to as many different things in as many different ways as you can until it clicks."
"Speake2","00:17:13:08","00:17:34:11","And I've seen that. So I'll give an example. When I was a teaching assistant, I taught a class. It was called Microelectronics Class, and basically the students had to build a robot rover and they had to program that rover from the ground up. And it was quite difficult in many ways because, you know, you're doing very low level programing."
"Speake2","00:17:34:13","00:18:00:07","And I had a student in that class who just would not get into the class. But one of the assignments later on in that class was one on music. So you had programed the the rover to do basically make some music or something like that. And that student got I mean, he just clicked with that music and you know, because of that one, that one section, he was able to pass that class."
"Speake2","00:18:00:07","00:18:25:16","I can't say that he excelled in the class, but that one thing motivated enough not only to do to to excel in that one section, but to finish out the class with, you know, at least a passing, you know, adequacy. So, you know, that's kind of my my anecdote of of what what it's what it's meant is you have someone that was, you know, completely not motivated."
"Speake2","00:18:25:18","00:18:40:16","And then it was just the fact that they got exposed to something that aligned with their interests. And that's all it took. And many times that's all it takes is really just for someone to understand that this exists and."
"Speake1","00:18:40:18","00:18:45:02","What impact have you made for China?"
"Speake2","00:18:45:04","00:19:02:17","That's a more good question. More than me? I don't know. You know, I've done my best. So, you know, I've tried to recruit people. We just finished teaching a class. So, I mean, beyond that and I. I can't I'm not a really good judge of my own in practice, so really."
"Speake1","00:19:02:19","00:19:12:20","No worries for one more thing. Um, what are your three takeaways for this?"
"Speake2","00:19:12:22","00:19:15:18","Well, three takeaways for, for what we're."
"Speake1","00:19:15:19","00:19:17:08","For in general. Like."
"Speake2","00:19:17:10","00:19:48:11","Uh, for the GI program or something. I think it's nice to see high school teachers that are interested in doing this. And so that's really great. And, and that's nice to see that they're not only is there an interest, but there's a recognized need. And so that's that's one of the main takeaways. The second takeaway that I really appreciate is everyone has at least some degree of the quote unquote imposter syndrome."
"Speake2","00:19:48:11","00:20:08:22","Right. And and that's okay. And, you know, and I and I also like to see that, too, because you don't you never really lose the imposter syndrome. You just you just become more familiar and you just you know, as you get more comfortable, it slowly kind of just trickles away. But it's always there because there's so much to know."
"Speake2","00:20:09:00","00:20:31:02","There's you never can get really get around it. It's not that that that's a good thing It's so much you know, the having an imposter syndrome you know feeling like you're not up to snuff. What what's good about it is, is that is it something that we can recognize and we can move to try to to eliminate? And so, like, I just had a class today."
"Speake2","00:20:31:02","00:20:52:10","And so a big part of what I did in that class was kind of teach a lot of the surrounding details to a particular lab so that people could feel more comfortable when they talked to lab. So they weren't just they weren't just entering in the the commands. They were they knew why they had the commands. They knew what the commands were affecting."
"Speake2","00:20:52:10","00:21:16:21","And, you know, there's a lot a lot of that that's involved because there's just a lot of knowledge that's required in this in this field. So that's two takeaways and then three takeaways. The third takeaway is, you know, where do we you know, this isn't a take away, it's more of a wish, really, but we potentially are at the cusp of something that could ten, 20 years from now really be a big deal."
"Speake2","00:21:16:22","00:21:38:09","And it's kind of nice to be in the ground for years. You know, that's that's kind of having worked in a startup, too. I understand that that's the best time, actually, when you're in that starting phase and everything's possible, you know, five years from now, it'll all be pretty fixed and everybody will be on autopilot. At least now we have a lot going on."
"Speake1","00:21:38:11","00:21:40:05","All right. Thank you so much."
"Speake2","00:21:40:07","00:21:46:19","Okay."
"Unknown","00:21:46:19","00:22:20:14","There you go. Okay. Can you briefly tell me about yourself? I am a librarian and I have spent most of my career working with public school and academic libraries. I just ended a role where I was working as a professional development specialist for educators, and I do a lot of training on technology integration. I am a computer science fundamentals trainer, and I have some background in cybersecurity."
"Unknown","00:22:20:16","00:22:52:07","All right. Can you tell me about your teaching philosophy? I am all about helping learners from where they're at and bringing them up. And that is really where I try to try to be where make you get involved in this ground. I have interest in cybersecurity and I think it's actually something we need to be talking about more."
"Unknown","00:22:52:09","00:23:24:18","I've been working for a number of years to increase computer science awareness in South Dakota, and cybersecurity fits right alongside that. And so far in South Dakota, I think that's a really important, important thing to increase awareness of. How do you motivate your students to learn about cyber security? To motivate my students, which are teachers who are adults, there has to be that that hook."
"Unknown","00:23:24:19","00:23:56:09","And part of it is making it so it isn't scary for them because they have to actually turn around and teach it to their their students and also helping them understand how it affects them in day to day life. And so we've done a lot of activities so far where we can actually go and see if our email address has been included in a breach of information and, you know, just those things where it affects you in in real life."
"Unknown","00:23:56:11","00:24:28:06","If you had a magic wand that will create an ideal teacher support program, what would it look like and ideal teacher support program would look like taking things off teacher's plates so that they're able to actually do the work that we'd like them to do. And so helping teachers prioritize and and removing some things from their from their lists."
"Unknown","00:24:28:08","00:25:00:18","Okay. What impact has child made for you in the classroom? It has been phenomenal. I mean, just from the communication and the information and the support that they've given since I've, you know, started with this grant, it's just been amazing. I haven't worked with the I'm taking notes in case I have another grant that I get to facilitate, because you've done such a good example of what to do in your life course."
"Unknown","00:25:00:20","00:25:31:00","What are your three takeaways for this year? My three takeaways for this year are we really need to emphasize the need learner mentality? Because I'm watching people get frustrated because it's not easy as like, well, we we just need to be that that lead learner. And so we're figuring it out together. A couple other things are there is a lot of really, you know, existing easy things out there that we can use to demonstrate the importance of cybersecurity."
"Unknown","00:25:31:02","00:25:53:17","And then finally, the awareness of the curriculum that exists already and how it's openly licensed. So we're able to like turn it into our own and align it with standards that we need to. Okay. Thank you so much, Julie. Thank you so."
"Unknown","00:25:53:17","00:26:35:14","Key. Can you briefly tell me about yourself? Oh, sure. So I have no background in cybersecurity, So I'm a linguist, but I'm a strong interest in national security and I have been teaching the world languages to our students from K to 12. Okay. Can you tell me about your teaching philosophy? I think students are very special and I like to look for students backgrounds, so I like to use a cultural relevance response instruction."
"Unknown","00:26:35:16","00:27:15:17","Okay. Mm hmm. All right. Um, what made you get involved in this grant? So I have been, uh, in the ground. We received a grant from Nash, and they say so I had a collaboration with Morgan, and we were talking about this fantastic program such as this. I have been thinking about using a cybersecurity skill and then learning the some of the background in applied to my own field."
"Unknown","00:27:15:19","00:27:56:18","How will your school help? And can our faculty support you? So I have I have no idea because I am a language person. I'm a linguist. So I can imagine that the equipment, the, um, all the supports from the hardware and software is important. So I can talk about talk much about that at this point. Now, um, let's see, what if I have you made for Chad?"
"Unknown","00:27:56:20","00:28:30:23","I think that coming from multicultural, not a linguistic background. And I think that I bring a little bit different perspective to the tie. And I think that from cybersecurity mindset to thinking about different world and and how this people have the background of their cybersecurity in other part of the world can help our society to strengthen our network when we ask questions."
"Unknown","00:28:31:05","00:29:08:15","Mm hmm. What are you three takeaways from this year? My with cyber. Where are your 3 to 3 take away? Okay, sure. So I think that I am in my students shoes because I had no background in cybersecurity, so I'm starting from zero. And since I am a fast learner, so I can thinking about how can I modify my approach, and then to make it easier for students to, uh, to learn and get the knowledge."
"Unknown","00:29:08:15","00:29:59:12","And also I see myself as a mom as and I think this is very beneficial for me to communicate with my child and then the last take away is I can see why is so important that in our daily practice is that um, how this benefit ourselves and not only the national security, but I think that in the future I probably want to use this kind of cybersecurity background and that can marry the world language of what we are doing in our programs to get a better approach for what NSA is looking for."
"Unknown","00:29:59:14","00:30:04:17","Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I hope I get is."
"Unknown","00:30:04:17","00:30:07:19","Right."
"Unknown","00:30:07:21","00:30:47:22","Can you briefly tell me about yourself? I am Jason Cochrane, a teacher in a high school in Douglas County, Colorado, Mountain Vista High School. I've been teaching for 16 years and mostly in science, so chemistry, biology or science, but primarily for the last eight years. Chemistry, right. Can you tell me about your teaching philosophy? My philosophy now is to teach kids to be problem solvers and to stick with problems when they're not easy."
"Unknown","00:30:48:00","00:31:25:00","So in the world of chemistry, I try to give them the content that they need and then provide a scenario to use that information. And I try my best not to just give them the answers. What made you get involved in this grant? I think after after 16 years of teaching and I am now pursuing a degree in cybersecurity as a graduate certificate in cybersecurity, and I've taken a few courses, one being career literacy that has really shown me the need for certain STEM positions."
"Unknown","00:31:25:01","00:32:07:00","Cybersecurity being a one that's in huge demand. I was actually looking at some data, looking at how many chemistry, biology and physics jobs there were. I was either 20 or 22 or 2021, and all of those combined were equivalent to the cybersecurity you need. How will your school health and care faculty support you? I think I'm fortunate in that I have a very supportive administration who I think would be very willing to add more comprehensive courses to to our building."
"Unknown","00:32:07:02","00:32:40:14","There's we're the third largest district in the entire state. There's one person in our district who teaches cybersecurity, right? If you had a magic wand that would create an ideal teacher support for what would you look like? I think an ongoing, ongoing community of other teachers within the same geographic area, but then also remotely as well. I think there's so much fun stuff with this, but it's not."
"Unknown","00:32:40:16","00:33:07:12","A lot of things aren't just intuitive using terminal commands are not intuitive. You know, missing a space can be making or breaking why something runs and something doesn't run. So being able to bounce things off of other people I think would be ideal. I'm fortunate in science. I have 13 other colleagues, but we have one computer science teacher and I think that's pretty typical at most schools, one person."
"Unknown","00:33:07:14","00:33:42:05","So having a support system readily available. What impact have you made for a child? Well, impact have I made? Well, hopefully being a science teacher for the last 16 years, I will be able to add some diversity to the to the cybersecurity teaching world. And and then and hopefully more teachers like me might find interest through this program."
"Unknown","00:33:42:06","00:34:15:16","I was recommended to this program by somebody from last year who's now in year two, and hopefully I can continue to spread that word and bring over more people from other disciplines. Okay. And last question, What are you three takeaways from this year? Three takeaways. I would say there is a very high demand for cybersecurity professionals. Salaries for students who want to pursue that career pathway are great."
"Unknown","00:34:15:18","00:34:45:22","I think it could be a game changer for students who potentially are lower socioeconomic status. Could send them on a completely different trajectory in life. I think there are looking at the curriculum multiple avenues for students to take. So with just minimal exposure and hopefully a liking into one of those areas, they might be able to choose one of those trajectories."
"Unknown","00:34:46:00","00:34:49:20","All right. Thank you so much. All right. Send some."
"Unknown","00:34:49:20","00:35:19:13","All right. Can you briefly tell me about yourself? My name is Bill Heldman. I've been teaching cybersecurity, computer science and machine learning for the last 17 years at a school in Lakewood, Colorado. Prior to that, it came out of a 21 year long I.T. career. All right. Can you tell me about your teaching philosophy? So my philosophy is very different than standard education."
"Unknown","00:35:19:13","00:35:46:13","I'm very focused on making sure that kids understand the technological depth of what we're trying to study. So it's really not about the textbook. It's about learning how the technology works. I'm also very focused on technological certifications. Okay. What made you get involved in the second year of China? So it's the first year I found out about the second year."
"Unknown","00:35:46:15","00:36:09:19","But I have been teaching cybersecurity for a long time. So, no, I'm not I'm not humble here. But I think that the first year would have probably been a little you know, I would have been bored in it. But this year I'm really glad I came the second year of learning a lot of new good things, and I'm glad I participated in this."
"Unknown","00:36:09:21","00:36:33:19","What have you done to motivate your students to learn about cybersecurity? So this is really interesting. Some students come in and they want to study cybersecurity, so they think that, you know, it sounds cool and then they get in and they find out what it's about and they're like, Oh, I'm going to go do something else. I have a lot of programmers that decide that they want to keep going down the cyber security road."
"Unknown","00:36:33:21","00:36:57:18","So I think it's good to teach cybersecurity at a good depth because what it does is it helps kiddos understand what's really going on in terms of cybersecurity and the depth of education that you have to have for it. And so I like really being able to show all of the tools. I like being able to teach Linux at a good depth."
"Unknown","00:36:57:19","00:37:19:23","I teach virtualization. You know, I'm very focused on making sure that kids understand all of the tools that go into it as well as the jobs. And we've got to be realistic. We were talking in class about, you know, the first job out is going to be help desk. We can't help that hell. And so most kids are going to want it going to help desk customer support."
"Unknown","00:37:20:01","00:37:38:20","And I get that. But the next stop in cybersecurity is going to be a security operations center analyst that's called the SOC analyst. They're going to look at a lot of back ups. It's not the best job in the world because it's very, you know, detail oriented. And I try to be a realist. So my kids know that they're going to be doing that."
"Unknown","00:37:38:22","00:38:00:05","Every kid I get in class wants to be a pen tester and is like, what? That's that's five years out. That's not something you're going to hit on year one. So I try to be really realistic with kids. How is it impacting your students? So these students really, really enjoy it. My students leave and we I have two years of first year."
"Unknown","00:38:00:05","00:38:26:16","Second year junior senior juniors are required to earn four certifications in their first year, and then in the second year they develop a what they call a capstone project plan. And a lot of the times the certifications are beneficial over go for other certs like security plus size, A-plus, Linux plus things like that, or interviews certs or whatever."
"Unknown","00:38:26:18","00:38:50:12","And so the concept there is that by the time the kids are seniors, they have an understanding of what the certification framework is about. You know, with CompTIA and others like that, and they know how to get those certs at this point out of the study for them. And so that's part of it. And then also part of it is, you know, internships, competitions."
"Unknown","00:38:50:13","00:39:12:05","We do a lot of cutoffs, you know, things like that. So I'm trying to get kids focused on, okay, you know, the details, but there's a lot of depth to what we're trying to accomplish, just like net cap or, you know, something like that. There's a lot of tools that take a little bit of study. So that's that's where I'm focused that I'm trying to accomplish."
"Unknown","00:39:12:07","00:39:40:02","Okay. What has your school done to help in promoting cyber security application in general for faculty support you? Oh, my gosh. My school. I teach a school called Warren Tech. It's and it's in the Jefferson County School District. So it's called Jeffco Schools is one of the largest school districts in Colorado, 168 schools. And my school is a career and technical education school."
"Unknown","00:39:40:02","00:40:07:06","So it's called CTE. And they have an incredibly supportive like they have and gone over the top support they pay for us cyber patriots. They're going to pay for NCL. They've paid for licenses for kids to get into hacker box. They supply me with all of the tools they need. They pay for testing out licenses for these kids to use the courseware to go through and study for the service."
"Unknown","00:40:07:08","00:40:30:11","All they want me to do is show up in teacher. So that that's been very, very supportive. I just changed over to a new principal. My own principal, there was a shake up and they shuffle principals. There's five principals and she left, went to we have three campuses, so she'll go to another campus. I've got a new principal, and he's actually even more supportive than my old principal was."
"Unknown","00:40:30:12","00:41:02:02","I'm very, very encouraged by that. So they've been very good. Right. And last question, what are you three takeaways from this year? What are the three takeaways for for this year? And wow, that's a really good question. So first takeaway is Skills for All, which is a Cisco Cisco regenerated networking academy and turned it into a free networking environment and Skills for All has a ton of things out there that teachers can download and use."
"Unknown","00:41:02:04","00:41:21:12","That's been part of the philosophy here. They've downloaded the labs and we go through the labs together, which I think is terrific and building a little book. So that's a good takeaway. Another takeaways on CEO, I had no idea about it, and one of our guys, I forgotten his name mentioned that I'm going to get actively engaged in NCL."
"Unknown","00:41:21:12","00:41:45:10","We're a member of U.S. Cyber Patriot, but it's not for everybody. Cyber Patriot is not exactly for everybody. So I think NCL is going to be super big. So that's a good takeaway for me. And then we have Brainiac who is talking to us right now. His name is Mike Haney, Dr. Haney, and he's been doing a lot of talking about crypto and that's a difficult subject."
"Unknown","00:41:45:10","00:42:07:00","That's a gnarly big subject, but it's getting me jazzed about teaching some more crypto When you teach crypto to 17 and 18 year olds, a lot of the eyes glaze over because they're like, What is he talking about? So now I'm getting I'm getting more jazzed about that and I'm going to go down that road a little bit more, I think, because I think that's super important."
"Unknown","00:42:07:02","00:42:23:15","Yeah, and I found some really good at the gym. There's a crypto gym in NCL, the super good. So I'm going to make kids go through that, right? Yeah. Thanks so much. Were you there? And then your name? Darren. Is that you have a little bit of an."
"Unknown","00:42:23:15","00:42:30:14","No see. All right."
"Unknown","00:42:30:16","00:43:06:05","Okay. Can you briefly tell me about yourself? Yeah, I, um. I teach in a small school in Saint Anthony, and I started teaching math, and then they started asking me, since I teach math, that I could teach computer programing. And then I got interested in cybersecurity. Right. Um, can you tell me about your teaching philosophy? Um, I think more my teaching philosophy is that everyone learns at a different pace, and I want all of them to know that they can learn it eventually and not to give up."
"Unknown","00:43:06:05","00:43:33:14","So just keep trying. And that's what I try to encourage my students to do. What made you get involved on the second year of Child? Mm hmm. I felt like I still needed to come back and see. I liked the skills for all that. There was more than I realized. That was in there. And I wanted to see the labs and get more involved in how we can do cybersecurity better in the schools."
"Unknown","00:43:33:15","00:43:56:17","Well, have you done to motivate your students to learn about cybersecurity? I try to tell them how much money they can make, but when some of them don't care about that, I just try to make it fun, fun for them and bring people in that can talk to them about what they can do with the skills. Yeah. How is it impacting your students?"
"Unknown","00:43:56:19","00:44:30:19","Um, I have some students that have not been aware of some things and where I teach at a junior high, it's sometimes even more about keeping them safe. So they didn't realize how much they could they needed to do to be more aware of what was going on on their phones. So now, especially on the phone. Yeah. Um, what has your school done to help in promoting cybersecurity, education and care Faculty support you?"
"Unknown","00:44:30:21","00:45:04:17","They are pretty open to letting me again. It's at a junior high, so it's just an elective. But my principal has let me do, you know, whatever I. I need more money. I'm not. I have zero money just because it's an elective. So I don't have any money. But our librarian wrote a grant for a makerspace and she came to me and asked me what I could possibly use to teach cybersecurity better and wrote the parts that I asked for in the grant."
"Unknown","00:45:04:17","00:45:29:02","And we got it. So hopefully a better place to teach it. All right. And last question, What are you three takeaways from this year? The three takeaways, I think that the three takeaways I definitely need to get I need to know more because some teachers can just give good projects and not know as much. But I need to know more because it makes me more confidence."
"Unknown","00:45:29:03","00:45:50:03","I've got to get some more and get some more studying done. But I also need to come up with better projects for the students so that they can. I've got to let them get further and let them try harder. Yeah, and not try to hold their hands. All right. Well, thank you so much. You're welcome."
"Unknown","00:45:50:03","00:46:23:10","All right. So can you briefly tell me about yourself? Yeah, absolutely. So my name is John Avery. I've been a teacher in engineering education principally for the last ten years after getting my degree in mechanical in engineering science, specialty mechanical engineering from Colorado State University. The reason why I've come to see it I had gotten involved in this program is that throughout my career I have found myself drifting more and more from physical manufacturing engineering into computer science."
"Unknown","00:46:23:12","00:46:48:04","And just the way that we use programing and computers, data and analytics to drive the work that we do. And so as a result of that, I'm transitioning into formal computer science, education and cybersecurity is a major component of that, something that I was afraid of getting into this. I knew that I needed to expand my knowledge on beyond what are a lot of our schools are just doing right now with respect to programing."
"Unknown","00:46:48:06","00:47:14:11","All right. Can you tell me about your teaching philosophy? Yeah. And so I'd say my biggest philosophy is around project based learning. The idea of giving students an authentic way to learn the content that we're working on, trying to get away from rote memorization while still has its place in this world, The students really need to see the applicability of what they're doing, and they need to have an investment in what they're doing."
"Unknown","00:47:14:11","00:47:45:17","And so I try to craft education that teaches them those basics of whether it's programing, cybersecurity or otherwise, but let some explore it through content that interests them and product formats. Right? What made you get involved on the second year of Troy? Yeah, the second year. So comparing the first and the second year, the first year was getting into cybersecurity, but it was also focusing on a lot of the essential basic concepts of computer science overall."
"Unknown","00:47:45:23","00:48:13:05","What I've really loved about the second year and drew me back is it's bringing it all together, tying it together to get that actual security focus for, All right, how do we use all these essential tools to do security work, to take a security perspective as we look at computing systems, businesses, organizations and the like? All right. What have you done to motivate your students to learn about cyber security?"
"Unknown","00:48:13:07","00:48:44:18","The biggest thing I've done to motivate students to learn cybersecurity is to encourage them to pursue their own career goals through cybersecurity. That is to say, cybersecurity is entering every part of industry. It's not something that is confined just to I.T. or just to government. We have businesses, hospitals, fashion industries, all sorts of different employers who are concerned about cybersecurity and need professionals in cybersecurity that have cross-disciplinary skills."
"Unknown","00:48:45:00","00:49:14:18","So to that end, I really want to give students educational opportunities that let them flex that, looking at how do we employ cybersecurity in a restaurant as opposed to, say, a school, right? How is it impacting your students? The number one where cybersecurity is impacting my students is giving them a different look at it. So much of what we've done in computer science at the high school level has been programing, programing, programing, programing."
"Unknown","00:49:14:23","00:49:40:19","And that's given students kind of the misunderstanding that it is all developer work when I.T. is really this massive field. And so cybersecurity is really opening up an entirely new perspective for students who maybe weren't as interested in that developer work, but are super interested in the ideas of cryptography or governance and compliance and all those different areas right."
"Unknown","00:49:40:21","00:50:17:03","What has your school done to help in promoting cyber security in case you think your faculty support you? Absolutely. So this is one thing that I've been pleasantly surprised with through the school district is just to see how our employers are getting students involved in the cybersecurity process, really encouraging them to participate aid in our I.T. department, either as summer workers or to work with our building technologists to learn about these processes, to give them their authentic experience, to learn about these processes, both because it helps us as a district, but also because it gives them the most."
"Unknown","00:50:17:03","00:50:42:23","Okay. So last question. What are you three takeaways from this year? Yeah. So I think my number one takeaway to start with is just that security is both easier and harder than people think it is. It's easier to get into. It doesn't take as much math knowledge or I.T. knowledge as people really initially expect. Yet at the same time, it is such an expansive field."
"Unknown","00:50:42:23","00:51:05:16","There are so many different aspects to cyber security that it does take the work of many different people to accomplish. And so in that way, it's both easier than harder than people anticipate. Number two was seeing just the need for cyber security. There are huge monolithic organizations Amazon, of course, Microsoft, the government that can employ cyber security professionals."
"Unknown","00:51:05:21","00:51:23:03","But so many of our cyber security needs need to get down to the mom and pop businesses of the United States, the small school districts, the home computer networks, so that people can feel more secure in their computing from day to day. And the third takeaway is that."
"Unknown","00:51:23:03","00:51:27:15","All right."
"Unknown","00:51:27:17","00:52:18:21","So can you briefly tell me about yourself? My name is Keith Peck, and I teach at Renton High starting out and I teach in the school district is in high school, and I'm also a computer science facilitator. So I help other teachers with computer science as well. Okay. Can you tell me about your teaching philosophy? I teach career technical education, so I really believe in hands on learning of our students to get like industry skills during class and that and both on a project based learning and universal design for learning, which is really why I like this program, because it digs into different applications and things you can do with students related to cyber security."
"Unknown","00:52:18:23","00:52:46:05","So what made you get involved on the second year of trial? The reason I decided to get involved in the second year is the first year providing so many different resources. And so I was interested to see how I could dig deeper into those. We're also trying to move our curriculum towards the cyber plus certification. And so I was interested to see what kind of labs and things we could do to bring it to life."
"Unknown","00:52:46:07","00:53:20:04","But hopes and thoughts about cert. All right. What have you done to motivate your students to learn about cyber security? I do a lot of different promotion. Again, the hands on activity demonstrating even though we have a networking lab. So getting students to see it and interact with it. And then the other thing we've done more at the district level is extend the class from a one trimester to two term master classes and have more opportunity to take it from a longer."
"Unknown","00:53:20:05","00:53:42:13","How is it impacting your students? I would say we're kind of still in the process of seeing that, but definitely there are students that are super interested in it and are taking other classes like networking or the author application just to learn more about computers and how they communicate with each other or how to secure them or break into them."
"Unknown","00:53:42:15","00:54:08:15","And we also are working to get like an apprenticeship for students as well. So they're kind of excited for the opportunity to actually go into industry and feel like, well, how your school done to help in promoting cyber security education? And can faculty support you? So like I said, we move from a one term Mr. to two trimester class."
"Unknown","00:54:08:15","00:54:32:09","So that helped give us more room to teach more server theory content. And the other thing that we're doing is like putting it as a part of a sequence for students so that they are ready to take on an apprenticeship or an internship by the time they leave high school. We also, of a number of classes are dual accredited so they can also earn college credit."
"Unknown","00:54:32:09","00:55:09:04","And these classes are high school as well. And last question, what are your three takeaways from this year? The three takeaways. The first one is just learning a little bit each day because there's so much to learn, right? So it can be overwhelming, but just a little bit each time. And understanding just the systems alone is really helpful because that can help you think through how somebody's either hacked in or how you might need to protect a system or you know where to look first."
"Unknown","00:55:09:05","00:55:41:07","So I think that's really helpful. Then the other thing I would take away is networking is a big fundamental to cyber security, right? Because that's how you're communicating a lot of these different processes. And so how students build their understanding of networking is equally as important. And then the third thing is that really having a group of teachers that's doing the same thing is also really helpful because you can share resources and ideas about what brand do or how we're going to implement this into our classroom."
"Unknown","00:55:41:09","00:55:46:17","The networking is really helpful. Yeah. Thank you so much."
"Unknown","00:55:46:17","00:56:27:11","Can you tell me about yourself? My name's from. My name's Tammy Foley. I teach at White River High School, which is just off the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. And I've been there for ten years. Can you tell me about your teaching philosophy? My philosophy is to keep the door open. A lot of kids really struggle to continue to make advancements, and my entire point of teaching is to just allow them to rejoin and step through that door whenever they decide it's finally time."
"Unknown","00:56:27:13","00:56:55:03","What made you get involved on this work in your show? This isn't going away. This is our future. This is how her entire world will operate. And if we want to make students that are prepared for the future, this has to be at the core of all their learning for. What have you done to motivate your students to learn about cybersecurity?"
"Unknown","00:56:55:05","00:57:19:01","You know a big thing about motivating student students is to offer carrots to so to show them like the coolest, neatest, greatest thing that innovators are doing, like Blue Origin. And once they have that interest going, then you can pull them in a little further and bring them down to earth and show them the steps it will take to get there."
"Unknown","00:57:19:03","00:58:01:06","But inspiring that, you know, creativity is the carrot you need to dangle to get kids into computer science. How is it impacting your students? The opportunities afforded to my students are innumerable. Less than 1% of 1% of Native American students go into computer science. So this is really a it's just a way for them to open the door and, you know, just be a part of the world in a way that they have yet to achieve."
"Unknown","00:58:01:08","00:58:28:01","What has your school done to help in promoting cyber security, education, and can a faculty support you? I absolutely have the support of the faculty and the superintendent. I'm in a very, very small school. There's only 100 students in the entire high school, and they've just been very supportive. And the good thing about it being so small is one student will tell another student."
"Unknown","00:58:28:03","00:58:56:01","And the popularity of computer science has just slowly built upon itself. It's really been a a grassroots movement that's worked for us. All right. And last question. What are you three takeaways from this year? My first takeaway is that these countries, these countries, these companies that are looking to hire these kids are really focused not on sitting and typing and programing."
"Unknown","00:58:56:03","00:59:20:21","They're interested in one soft skills to the ability to just wonder and inquire and do things on their own. And three, just having the ability to work with other people. Anyone can be learned, can be learned, can be taught, you know, how to code and what the all the little messages mean and hashtag and all these little codes."
"Unknown","00:59:20:23","00:59:38:14","But to be able to work in a group, to be able to just wonder and then follow this little pathway that's harder to teach. And that's what they're looking for. All right. Thank you so much. Have you added those?"
"Unknown","00:59:38:14","01:00:18:01","Okay. And can you briefly tell me about yourself? One come from Colombia. I'm here teaching about six years member computer science for a population that is coming from other countries, most of them. So I was kind of 98 Latino community percent Title one school. That's kind of what I'm doing there. Okay. Can you tell me about your teaching philosophy?"
"Unknown","01:00:18:03","01:00:55:03","A I love to mix when teaching without critical skills. So I love when they research, they share their value with other students. So I try to they kind of investigate or do projects in ways they have to finally share with others and compare. What was the process? The results at the end or what they come out with at the end of different?"
"Unknown","01:00:55:05","01:01:25:19","Okay. What made you get involved on the second year of training? Well, so I was part of that program, a child program last year. Can you repeat that? One way you get involved on the second year of Che. I was last year as a first time the show program, and it was my first year teaching computer cybersecurity. So it was a good experience."
"Unknown","01:01:25:19","01:02:07:01","I only had a distance, but they were really engaged. I mean, was working very well also. I think that come to the second year, more to invest more in my students, they say good opportunity. Right. What have you done to motivate your students to learn about summer security? I think that they are finding that there are a lot of opportunities in this field and there are a lot of policy issues that are not just filling in but the company."
"Unknown","01:02:07:01","01:02:46:14","So I'm trying to find out and show them different positions. Seen cybersecurity and not just the computer sciences coding, but also they have multiple options in, say, cybersecurity. How other people are doing this? I try to tell them roles. Yeah, that's okay. Mm hmm. How is it impacting your students and saying I'm okay? How is it impacting your students?"
"Unknown","01:02:46:16","01:03:27:20","Um, well, I think that they notice there are new ways to or new policy shows that they maybe they know about it. So it's kind of, Oh, I want to learn days are bad or is that use is the part that they think that these hackers you know they usually are really these with a hard core mission and so I tried they fared so well that I have to be safe in simple ways how to maintain information, secure good passwords, things like that."
"Unknown","01:03:27:22","01:04:02:16","And then also when we go deep into about how to take to pretend that they attack something and how they discover that a team of us doing or how has your school done to help in promoting cybersecurity education and can our faculty support you? Well, I think that they visit me kind of two or three times in particular during the cybersecurity class."
"Unknown","01:04:02:16","01:04:44:01","And they love and they see how students are changing information. You show they know, they communicate and they like it. So they they support me by providing the consumers information and also try to give more stories So much to us. All right. What are you three takeaways from this year? Well, I, um, something that I really like. Maybe I don't have to, but something I really want to do is try to participate in the computer use, because I'm always I feel afraid of that."
"Unknown","01:04:44:01","01:04:56:08","But I just going to try to win my students and give them the opportunity to participate and feel like they can do it. Yeah. Right. Thank you."
"Unknown","01:04:56:08","01:05:37:14","All right. So can you tell me about yourself? Mm. My name's Ryan Ford. Autonomous Fault School District. For 20 years, I've taught everything in business, marketing and a little bit of tech. Okay. Can you briefly tell me your teaching philosophy? Um, my teaching philosophy is to be a guide for the students and provide, um, learn necessarily specific topic information and general education to help them succeed in their future endeavors."
"Unknown","01:05:37:16","01:05:49:03","Maybe. Okay. What made you get involved on the second year of child administration told me how to know."
"Unknown","01:05:49:05","01:06:19:19","Curiosity. I wanted to see how the system has progressed and get more education than I can pass on to my students because year one just kind of introduces you to cybersecurity. But it's not really hands on. So I was looking for more of the hands on activities that the students really want. That's what I was looking for on a year to Well, have you done to motivate your students to learn about cyber security?"
"Unknown","01:06:19:21","01:06:49:22","Um, quite a lot. Just haven't done anything to motivate my students to learn about cybersecurity. The motivation was already there for the most part, but I have mentioned it in other classes. So to see if I can pique some more interest in cybersecurity, you know, talked about the job availability. And so if you don't know what you want to do, really check into cybersecurity because even if you don't think you are qualified for cybersecurity, there's several different avenues in cybersecurity."
"Unknown","01:06:49:22","01:07:15:23","So I've talked about that in my econ class and my web design class, and then my DECA Club and my business and my student store. But I've mentioned cybersecurity now more than I did before, right? Well, how is your school done to help in promoting cybersecurity education? And can our faculty support you? The administration completely supports me. It's been great as far as that goes."
"Unknown","01:07:15:23","01:07:42:14","And then I also have caller's part because, um, in my particular scenario, it is a dual credit class and dual credit is self selling. So my counselors now sell it to not only the high end students, but the students that are interested in computer science or are interested in the tech. We also have a tech high school so that the students at the tech high school will now stay to take one of my classes as well."
"Unknown","01:07:42:16","01:07:54:09","So it sells itself and I've got the support from the counselors and from the administration because it has that college credit attached to it."
"Unknown","01:07:54:11","01:08:35:04","And last question, what are you three takeaways from this year? I think the grant is moving. It's not there yet, but it's moving towards simplification, better communication and organization have also taken away a lot more of the hands on activities and a little bit better of a direction. And definitely this year has driven home the point that there are several different layers to cybersecurity."
"Unknown","01:08:35:04","01:08:53:16","So you don't have to be the techie you can go into. The more of the threat side of this, I think is where you go on the analysis side of things, or you can go to the actual application and network side of things. So for me, really the three takeaways this year is there's a network side of things, there's a, there's an analyst side of things, and then there's a threat side of things."
"Unknown","01:08:53:18","01:09:06:07","As far as cybersecurity goes, even on the hands on side, the Amazon side, all three of those are hands on now. All right. Thank you."
"Unknown","01:09:06:07","01:09:34:08","All right. Can you tell me about yourself? Hi, I'm Fred Newman. I teach at Brookings High School in Brookings, South Dakota. And I've been teaching while 28 years now. And the last ten years or so, I've been doing computer sciences and engineering and business and broadcast media. So video production stuff. Can you tell me about your teaching philosophy?"
"Unknown","01:09:34:10","01:09:59:15","I like to get everybody involved, especially as a CTE instructor. I prefer a lot more hands on so that students can apply themselves. And the philosophy is, especially with with coding and computer science, is that everybody can do it. I mean, we all have different levels, but it's kind of the great equalizer because if you can learn to code, there are so many outlets for that creativity and applied sciences."
"Unknown","01:09:59:17","01:10:26:08","All right. What made you get involved in this right. I saw this. I mean, several teachers and I had been talking about cybersecurity and computer sciences. And we've just slowly been getting the computer sciences in. It's it's been pretty slow in South Dakota to get it adopted as a curriculum. But we did get an approval a couple of years ago, and we were still working on getting an all of the the curriculums going."
"Unknown","01:10:26:10","01:10:47:05","But it's gotten more and more traction within our state. And I really believe it's important and it's a wide open field right now. So it's a lot of opportunities for my students. All right. How do you motivate your stories to learn about cybersecurity? I think by providing opportunities, I mean, that's a big part, is provide the opportunities and provide the classes for them to see it."
"Unknown","01:10:47:06","01:11:07:21","I do a lot of introductory, so hopefully they get an interest in it. And we also have some other computer science classes within our school. But that's how I'm doing it. And they can see what they can do and try different things. Okay. How will your school help and can our faculty support you? The school's already helping quite a bit."
"Unknown","01:11:07:21","01:11:30:04","I mean, it provides us a lot of leeway in trying new things. So it's supportive in that that we can try to do development curriculums. And the next year, I'm hoping within the next year or two is to get a cybersecurity course all on its own right now. And my cybersecurity is just part of a semester long class and I want a whole lot more than that."
"Unknown","01:11:30:06","01:11:53:12","All right. If you had a magic wand that would create an ideal teacher support program, what would it look like? I would love to have the materials available, whether it's permanent within our school or it's something that we can share between all the schools around the area. And so we can take turns using those materials. You know, like the raspberry pies now have a real big expense up front."
"Unknown","01:11:53:13","01:12:19:20","Well, I mean, it is if you buy a lot of them, but just having those materials available so we could bring those in or have those within our means or for our disposal, and then having probably the Internet support and I.T. support so that we could have dedicated networks that we're allowed to work with in its one virtual area so that students can explore without causing problems or more problems."
"Unknown","01:12:19:22","01:13:02:17","So that'd be my magic wand if I could. All right. What impact has shown me for you so far? It's provided me the opportunities to see who else, especially meeting the other teachers from South Dakota, but teachers from all over the country and seeing what's available for us and what potential there is. And then during while we're here, meeting the other professionals that are in the industry and seeing that and that it goes beyond just what's here in the West Coast, but going all across the Midwest to where we are, that the opportunities are there for us right."
"Unknown","01:13:02:19","01:13:10:19","And one last question. What are your three takeaways from this year?"
"Unknown","01:13:10:21","01:13:30:18","Try and just try. I mean, that's all the big takeaways. Just need to get in there and put things in place for the students to have opportunities. So there's one and then another one is there are so many resources out there available for us. So ask and then just go for it. And so that would be my three takeaways."
"Unknown","01:13:30:20","01:13:34:03","All right. Thank you so much. Thank you."
"Unknown","01:13:34:03","01:13:39:15","Good."
"Unknown","01:13:39:17","01:14:11:00","Can you tell me about yourself? My name is Jeremy Demaree. I'm from walked in South Dakota. I've been in technology for the last 20 some years and network administrator for school. And I've recently started working on be able to teach some classes as well. Okay. Can you tell me about your teaching philosophy? I guess the way I like to learn is by doing hands on."
"Unknown","01:14:11:01","01:14:32:23","I'm a hands on learner, so that's kind of a philosophy I'm going with. Try to have a lot of labs and hands on for the students. Not as many paper or pencil tests. I think students learn better that way. At least I did. So guess that's what I like to go with that. All right. Well, when you get involved in this grant."
"Unknown","01:14:33:01","01:15:01:05","Oh, I had a friend emailed me and a coworker both said, Hey, look at this. There's availability. Go out to Seattle and learn some cyber stuff. I thought, Well, this sounds like fun odds in the summer. And that's what I plan on. Teaching is cybersecurity in our school. So I thought, perfect opportunity. All right. How do you motivate your students to learn about their security?"
"Unknown","01:15:01:07","01:15:29:19","I relate it to their own life. You point out all the things that they do daily on their personal devices and relate how cyber security is important to them personally. And then hopefully that will help them to realize, hey, maybe that's something I should look into doing. Right. How will your school help and kind of faculty support you?"
"Unknown","01:15:29:21","01:15:59:03","My school, actually. I don't have a teaching certificate, so my school is actually helping me out with the ability to go teach with another teacher. Since I am a network administrator, rather than having to go back to school and get a teaching certificate. They're supporting me to teach these classes by go teaching with another teacher. All right. If you had a magic wand that would create an ideal teacher support program, what would it look like?"
"Unknown","01:15:59:05","01:16:34:19","Oh, you know, lots of funding. Funding to try new things. Labs. You know, administration and public public support. Cyber security doesn't touch, touch. Just, you know, school. I mean, that's is everyone. So being able to have public support for further programs and involvement would be great, too, Right. What impact has child made for your for you in the classroom has given us great opportunity, great curriculum."
"Unknown","01:16:34:20","01:17:02:05","There's lots of hands on labs that we've learned while we're out here. It gives us a nice roadmap to when we get back to our schools of how to implement these ideas and cybersecurity to be successful. Right. And one last question. What are you three takeaways for this year? Three takeaways."
"Unknown","01:17:02:07","01:17:27:23","That's a good one as a number one, read through your curriculum ahead of time. I've always helped to service securities inform for everyone. And three, Seattle is great place to come learn. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you."
